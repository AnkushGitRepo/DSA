# DSA Practice Repository

Welcome to my **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** practice repository! This repository contains a collection of DSA questions and their solutions, structured in a way that helps me improve my problem-solving skills.

### Purpose
This repository is purely for my personal practice and improvement. It is not intended for professional reference, but rather as a personal journal of DSA questions that I've solved and will continue solving.

## Structure of the Repository

- Each folder represents a category or topic of DSA (e.g., Arrays, Linked List, Sorting, etc.).
- Inside each topic folder, you'll find:
  - **`README.md`**: A brief description of the topic and important concepts.
  - **Solutions**: Each question's solution will be named according to the problem statement and will contain a structured solution.
  - **Problem Description**: In some cases, solution will be paired with the problem description in the same folder.
 
### [Google Sheet Of Problems](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1TetBwm7t2C7iLewzVCl_U6UT0U6bGjCu0xr4HdeLsyA/edit?usp=sharing)

### Topics Covered (ongoing):
- Arrays
- Linked Lists
- Stacks & Queues
- Trees
- Graphs
- Dynamic Programming
- Greedy Algorithms
- Sorting & Searching
- Hashing
- Recursion

## How to Navigate the Repository
1. Each folder contains problems categorized by DSA topics.
2. Every topic has its own file for the description and solution, making it easy to navigate and review.
3. Solutions are written in Java and follow a consistent format to keep the code easy to understand.

## Progress

I will continue to update this repository as I solve more questions, explore different algorithms, and learn new techniques. This is a work in progress, and every solved problem will be accompanied by its description and solution.

Feel free to check out the problems and solutions, but remember this repository is primarily for personal learning purposes!

## Contributions

No contributions are required as this is a personal project. However, suggestions and feedback are welcome if you'd like to discuss approaches to the problems I've solved.
