    - Prefix Sum 2D Array

This file is useful for understanding multidimensional arrays and solving problems that involve matrix manipulation.

### 3. [MiscProblems.java](https://github.com/AnkushGitRepo/DSA/blob/main/src/main/java/org/example/Arrays/MiscProblems.java)
This file includes various miscellaneous array problems and their solutions, such as:
- **Rearranging Arrays**: Sorting arrays and rearranging elements under certain conditions.
- **Prefix Sum Problem**: Efficiently solving problems related to cumulative sums of array elements.
- **Kadane's Algorithm**: Finding the maximum sum subarray (useful for solving dynamic programming problems).

These problems are a bit more complex and provide a solid understanding of algorithmic problem-solving using arrays.

### 4. [TwoSumAndThreeSum.java](https://github.com/AnkushGitRepo/DSA/blob/main/src/main/java/org/example/Arrays/TwoSumAndThreeSum.java)
This file covers the classic array problems of finding pairs or triplets that sum up to a target value:
- **Two Sum Problem**: Finding two numbers in an array that add up to a specific target.
- **Three Sum Problem**: Finding three numbers in an array that add up to a specific target.

### 5. [ArrayListBasics.java](https://github.com/AnkushGitRepo/DSA/blob/main/src/main/java/org/example/Arrays/ArrayListBasics.java)
This file demonstrates the use of `ArrayList` in Java, covering:
- **ArrayList Initialization**: Creating and initializing ArrayLists.
- **ArrayList Operations**: Adding, removing, and updating elements in ArrayLists.
- **ArrayList Methods**: Common methods used with ArrayLists.
- **ArrayList vs. Arrays**: Comparing the features and use cases of ArrayLists and arrays.

### 6. [QuestionByTUFChannel.java](https://github.com/AnkushGitRepo/DSA/blob/main/src/main/java/org/example/Arrays/QuestionByTUFChannel.java)
This file contains solutions to array problems from the YouTube channel "Take U Forward" (TUF). The problems include:
- **Find the Duplicate Number**: Given an array of integers, find the duplicate number in it.
- **Move Zeroes**: Move all zeroes to the end of the array while maintaining the relative order of non-zero elements.
- **Union and Intersection of Two Arrays**: Find the union and intersection of two arrays.
- **Finds the missing number**: Finds the missing number in an array containing n distinct numbers taken from 0, 1, 2, ..., n.
- **Finds the single number**: Finds the single number in an array where every element appears twice except for one.
- **Maximum consecutive ones**: Finds the maximum number of consecutive 1s in an array with at most one 0 allowed to flip.
- **Subarray with sum K**: Finds the subarray with a given sum K in an array.
- **Majority Element**: Finds the majority element in an array (element that appears more than n/2 times).
- **Maximum Subarray Sum**: Finds the maximum sum of a contiguous subarray within an array.
- **Intersection of Two Arrays II**: Given two integer arrays nums1 and nums2, return an array of their intersection. Each element in the result must appear as many times as it shows in both arrays and you may return the result in any order.
- **Max Consecutive Ones III**: Given a binary array nums and an integer k, return the maximum number of consecutive 1's in the array if you can flip at most k 0's.

### 7. [neetcodeArrays.java](https://github.com/AnkushGitRepo/DSA/blob/main/src/main/java/org/example/Arrays/neetcodeArrays.java)
- **Contains Duplicate**: Given an integer array nums, return true if any value appears at least twice in the array, and return false if every element is distinct.
- **Valid Anagram**: Given two strings s and t, return true if t is an anagram of s, and false otherwise.
- **Concatenation of Array** : Given an integer array nums of length n, you want to create an array ans of length `2n` where `ans[i] == nums[i]` and `ans[i + n] == nums[i]` for `0 <= i < n` `(0-indexed)`.
- **Replace Elements with Greatest Element on Right Side**: Given an array arr, replace every element in that array with the greatest element among the elements to its right, and replace the last element with -1.
- **Is Subsequence**: Given two strings s and t, return true if s is a subsequence of t, or false otherwise.
- **Length of Last Word**: Given a string s consisting of some words separated by some number of spaces, return the length of the last word in the string. A word is a maximal substring consisting of non-space characters only.
- **Longest Common Prefix**: Write a function to find the longest common prefix string amongst an array of strings. If there is no common prefix, return an empty string `""`.
- **Group Anagrams**: Given an array of strings `strs`, group the anagrams together. You can return the answer in any order.
- **Valid Parentheses**: Given a string s containing just the characters '(', ')', '{', '}', '[' and ']', determine if the input string is valid.
- **Pascal's Triangle**: Given an integer `numRows`, return the first numRows of Pascal's triangle.
- **Remove Element**: Given an integer array `nums` and an integer `val`, remove all occurrences of `val` in `nums` in-place. The relative order of the elements may be changed.
- **Unique Email Addresses**: Every valid email consists of a local name and a domain name, separated by the '@' sign. Besides lowercase letters, these emails may contain '.'s or '+'s.
- **Isomorphic Strings**: Given two strings `s` and `t`, determine if they are isomorphic. Two strings are isomorphic if the characters in `s` can be replaced to get `t`.
- **Majority Element**: Given an array `nums` of size `n`, return the majority element. The majority element is the element that appears more than `n / 2` times. You may assume that the majority element always exists in the array.
